Chapter 1
---------

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

The lazy dog, slumped on the ground like a rug, opened his eyes and impassively 
watched the fox scamper down to the end of the garden. The sun was bright and hot
overhead and many small flying insects buzzed frantically around the dog's head.

"Why are the creatures of The Woodland always in such a rush?" he wondered.

Snorting grumpily, the lazy dog buried his shaggy head back down into his
bed and returned to his nap.

Chapter 3
---------

The lazy dog continued to snooze in the hot midday sun. He had gone for a walk
earlier and felt he deserved a long nap after his lunch. He had dined on some
scraps of meat that had fallen from the farmer's table, suplemented with some
raw carrots raided from the pantry.
