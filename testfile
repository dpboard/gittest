Chapter 1
---------

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

The lazy dog, slumped on the ground like a rug, opened his eyes and impassively 
watched the fox scamper down to the end of the garden. The sun was bright and hot
overhead and many small flying insects buzzed frantically around the dog's head.

"Why are the creatures of The Woodland always in such a rush?" he wondered.

Snorting grumpily, the lazy dog buried his shaggy head back down into his
bed and returned to his nap.
